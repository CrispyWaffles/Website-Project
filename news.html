              <p>Dodge has been sending its beloved Charger and Challenger muscle cars out with a bang, slowly revealing its Last Call Editions. With all the model specs released to the public we can look at quite the options we have. We can see we have 7 different models throughout the charger and challenger line, which are all tricked out with some insane power. With the new release of these cars many are wondering as to what Dodge will be getting into now. The short answer is, following the trend and moving towards electric vehicles. Dodge had already showcased one of their prototypes of an all-electric charger called the Banshee. As of now that’s all we have on the new model as we have not received any further information from Dodge itself. </p>

              <p>Chevrolet have recently announced that the 6th generation of the Camaro will be going out of production in January of 2024. This comes as a surprise as no one expected them to throw in the flag this early. While the details are not clear yet, Chevy has made a statement saying they will be releasing a Collector’s edition of the vehicle for the final year, allowing those who are fond of this vehicle to have a little something extra special. At the time of this writing there has been no updated news regarding the new edition or any details about the possible packages possible. Although this may seem like a bad thing, Chevy has also announced that the Camaro name will live on. We have no idea what this could mean as Chevy always has a trick up their sleeves so this will be of great wonders to all of us. </p>

              <p>Ram has issued a recall with their 2021 Ram 1500’s due to an ECU problem. More specifically the Ram 1500 with a 5.7L eTorque engine. Ram has come out to say that they are aware of a major flaw with the ECU in the vehicle not properly mixing fuel. The ECU allows the mixture of fuel to either get too lean or too rich allowing the fuel mixture in the engine to be incorrect. This has shown to cause the engine of the vehicle stalling which can be a serious safety risk. As of now there has only been one supposed incident involving this specific model but there has been no confirmation. For anyone who owns this vehicle, its recommended you take your vehicle into your nearest dealership for an ECU swap free of charge to ensure you don’t have this issue.</p>

              <p>For those in the market for an electric vehicle, now is the perfect time. While the price may be a deterring factor, the pros in the situation might outweigh it. With the new regulations set in place, those who purchase or lease a new EV can get a tax credit of up to $7,500. This serves as a great incentive for those to purchase a new vehicle while being able to save money on it. There are a few rules and regulations that the vehicle needs to pass for you to be able to get the credit, but that’s not a major concern if you plan on purchasing from the big names as they fit the requirements. So, if you wanted to get yourself a new Tesla Model S, there’s no time than now to get it.</p>
